This repository details the conceptual and prototype design of a function generator using the Fourier Series estimation through the use of Direct Digital Synthesis techniques. Various architectures are discussed to determine what is optimal for this design.

This Project was completed by @RobertJKatz, @BenjiLewis and @cairinmichie.
