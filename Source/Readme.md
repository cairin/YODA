# The Fourier Awakens
## Source Code

All source code for The Fourier Awakens project is in this folder.

***

1. Matlab
	- Contains the matlab code used to generate the Fourier coefficients used in the DDS modules.
2. Python Communicator
	- Contains a potential communications module to communicate with the FPGA.
	- Was not implemented in The Fourier Awakens.
3. Uncompiled verilog
	- Contains all the Verilog code used in The Fourier Awakens.
	- Was tested and compiled in [ISE](http://www.xilinx.com/products/design-tools/ise-design-suite.html) on the [Nexys4](http://www.xilinx.com/support/documentation/university/XUP%20Boards/XUPNexys4/documenatation/Nexys4_RM_VB1_Final_3.pdf) FPGA.
	- YODA Commented.zip contains the same code, with latest compiled version.
4. Prac 7
	- Contains a preliminary practical that shows a BCD clock on the FPGA.
